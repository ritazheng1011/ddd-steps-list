        <h3>Apply to Penn State</h3>
        <p>
          When completing your application, choose from our twenty campuses and
          select a first-choice and an alternate campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re enrolling in the 2+2 Plan, there’s no need to reapply when
          transitioning to your second campus. This streamlined process makes it
          easy to start at one campus and move seamlessly to another as you
          progress in your studies.
